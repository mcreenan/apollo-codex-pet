Create one horizontal animation strip for Codex pet `apollo-clay`, state `waiting`.

Use the attached canonical base for identity. Use the attached layout guide only for slot count, spacing, centering, and padding; do not draw the guide.

Output exactly 6 full-body frames in one left-to-right row on flat pure chroma green #00B140. Treat the row as 6 invisible equal-width slots: one centered complete pose per slot, evenly spaced, with no overlap, clipping, empty slots, labels, or borders.

Identity: same pet in every frame: White/creme coat, brown saddle patches on back and sides, brown face mask with clean white central blaze from muzzle to forehead, brown ears, white chest/legs/belly, dark nose, warm brown eyes, friendly slightly goofy expression.. Preserve silhouette, face, proportions, markings, palette, material, style, and props.
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `clay`: Handmade clay or polymer-clay mascot with rounded sculpted forms, soft material texture, simple features, and clean readable edges. User style notes: keep the exact style, palette, proportions, and markings of the canonical base image across every row..
Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Needs-input loop: expectant asking pose for approval, help, or user input.

State requirements:
- Show that Codex needs approval, help, or user input through an expectant asking pose.
- Keep the motion patient and readable, without turning it into ordinary idle or review.

Smooth-loop contract: Use the attached current pose-family anchor to keep Apollo sitting attentive in exactly that stance. The six slots are consecutive in-between instants of ONE seamless motion cycle, including frame 6 flowing directly into frame 1—not six distinct poses. Lock camera, scale, body position, footing, and the same raised-forepaw configuration in every slot; the forepaw stays raised for the ENTIRE loop and is never lowered. Adjacent frames must be nearly identical and read as the next instant. Let only the raised paw bob a few pixels, the head gently tilt a few degrees to one side and return over the loop, and ears perk subtly. Nothing else moves.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key green #00B140 inside the pet.
